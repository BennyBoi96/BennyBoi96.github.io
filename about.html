                <h1>Process of Creating this Multiple Choice Quiz Website</h1>
                <p> This website and quiz were programmed using coding with HTML, 
                    CSS and a bit of JavaScript. HTML was used for all the writing 
                    and text on the website and to create the multiple-choice question 
                    quiz, while CSS was used for all the designing, such as the images, 
                    the colors and font size of the writing, the margins, and overall 
                    structure of the website. Lastly, some JavaScript was used to program 
                    the functions of some buttons which switch to another page when clicking on 
                    them, such as the score and result page after finishing the quiz. </p>
                <h2>Information About the Quiz</h2>    
                <p>This multiple-choice question quiz consists of 10 different questions with various 
                    school subjects. The quiz includes math, geography, history, and science questions with 
                    medium difficulty. For each question there are four different answers with only one correct 
                    one, so be sure to carefully read the question and choose the correct answer!</p>
